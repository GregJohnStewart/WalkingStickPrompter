But as regards the spies, I canspeak with personal knowledge in saying that they do exist, and invery large numbers, not only in England, but in every part of Europe.As in the case of ghosts, any phenomenon which people don'tunderstand, from a sudden crash on a quiet day to a midnight creak ofa cupboard, has an affect of alarm upon nervous minds. So also a spyis spoken of with undue alarm and abhorrence, because he is somewhatof a bogey.As a first step it is well to disabuse one's mind of the ideathat every spy is necessarily the base and despicable fellow he isgenerally held to be. He is often both clever and brave.The term "spy" is used rather indiscriminately, and has by use come tobe a term of contempt. As a misapplication of the term "spy" the caseof Major André always seems to me to have been rather a hard one. Hewas a Swiss by birth, and during the American War of Independence in1780 joined the British Army in Canada, where he ultimately becameA.D.C. to General Sir H. Clinton.The American commander of a fort near West Point, on the Hudson River,had hinted that he wanted to surrender, and Sir H. Clinton sent Andréto treat with him. In order to get through the American lines Andrédressed himself in plain clothes and took the name of John Anderson.He was unfortunately caught by the Americans and tried by courtmartial and hanged as a spy.As he was not trying to get information, it seems scarcely right tocall him a spy. Many people took this view at the time, and GeorgeIII. gave his mother a pension, as well as a title to his brother, andhis body was ultimately dug up and re-interred in Westminster Abbey.THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SPIES.Let us for the moment change the term "spy" to "investigator" or"military agent." For war purposes these agents may be divided into:1. _Strategical_ and diplomatic _agents_, who study the political andmilitary conditions in peace time of all other countries which mighteventually be in opposition to their own in war. These also createpolitical disaffection and organise outbreaks, such, for instance,as spreading sedition amongst Egyptians, or in India amongst theinhabitants, or in South Africa amongst the Boer population, to bringabout an outbreak, if possible, in order to create confusion and drawoff troops in time of war.2. _Tactical_, military, or naval _agents_, who look into minordetails of armament and terrain in peace time. These also maketactical preparations on the spot, such as material for extra bridges,gun emplacements, interruption of communications, etc.3. _Field spies_. Those who act as scouts in disguise to reconnoitrepositions and to report moves of the enemy in the field of war.Amongst these are residential spies and officer agents.All these duties are again subdivided among agents of every grade,from ambassadors and their attachés downwards. Naval and militaryofficers are sent to carry out special investigations by allcountries, and paid detectives are stationed in likely centres togather information.There are also traitor spies. For these I allow I have not a goodword. They are men who sell their countries' secrets for money.Fortunately we are not much troubled with them in England; but we havehad a notorious example in South Africa.STRATEGICAL AGENTS.The war treason--that is, preliminary political and strategicalinvestigation--of the Germans in the present campaign has notbeen such a success as might have been expected from a scheme sowonderfully organised as it has been. With the vast sums spent uponit, the German General Staff might reasonably have obtained men in ahigher position in life who could have gauged the political atmospherebetter than was done by their agents immediately before the presentcrisis.Their plans for starting strikes at a critical time met with noresponse whatever. They had great ideas of stirring up strife anddiscontent among the Mahommedan populations both in Egypt and inIndia, but they calculated without knowing enough of the Eastern racesor their feelings towards Great Britain and Germany--more especiallyGermany.They looked upon the Irish question as being a certainty for civil warin Britain, and one which would necessitate the employment of a largeproportion of our expeditionary force within our own islands.They never foresaw that the Boer and Briton would be working amicablyin South Africa; they had supposed that the army of occupation therecould never be removed, and did not foresee that South Africa wouldbe sending a contingent against their South African colonies while theregulars came to strengthen our army at home.They imagined the Overseas Dominions were too weak in men and shipsand training to be of any use; and they never foresaw that the manhoodof Great Britain would come forward in vast numbers to take up armsfor which their national character has to a large extent given themthe necessary qualifications. All this might have been discoveredif the Germans had employed men of a higher education and socialposition.TACTICAL AGENTS.In addition to finding out military details about a country, such asits preparedness in men, supplies, efficiency, and so on, these agentshave to study the tactical features of hills and plains, roads andrailways, rivers and woods, and even the probable battlefields andtheir artillery positions, and so on.The Germans in the present war have been using the huge guns whoseshells, owing to their black, smoky explosions, have been nicknamed"Black Marias" or "Jack Johnsons." These guns require strong concretefoundations for them to stand upon before they can be fired. Butthe Germans foresaw this long before the war, and laid their plansaccordingly.They examined all the country over which they were likely to fight,both in Belgium and in France, and wherever they saw good positionsfor guns they built foundations and emplacements for them. This wasdone in the time of peace, and therefore had to be done secretly.In order to divert suspicion, a German would buy or rent a farm onwhich it was desired to build an emplacement. Then he would put downfoundations for a new barn or farm building, or--if near a town--fora factory, and when these were complete, he would erect some lightlyconstructed building upon it.There was nothing to attract attention or suspicion about this, andnumbers of these emplacements are said to have been made before warbegan. When war broke out and the troops arrived on the ground, thebuildings were hastily pulled down and there were the emplacements allready for the guns.Some years ago a report came to the War Office that a foreign Powerwas making gun emplacements in a position which had not before beensuspected of being of military value, and they were evidently going touse it for strategical purposes.I was sent to see whether the report was true. Of course, it wouldnot do to go as an officer--suspicions would be aroused, one wouldbe allowed to see nothing, and would probably be arrested as a spy.I therefore went to stay with a friendly farmer in the neighbourhood,and went out shooting every day among the partridges and snipe whichabounded there. The first thing I did was to look at the countrygenerally, and try to think which points would be most valuable aspositions for artillery.Then I went to look for partridges (and other things!) on the hillswhich I had noticed, and I very soon found what I wanted.Officers were there, taking angles and measurements, accompanied byworkmen, who were driving pegs into the ground and marking off lineswith tapes between them.As I passed with my gun in my hand, bag on shoulder, and dog at heel,they paid no attention to me, and from the neighbouring hills I wasable to watch their proceedings.When they went away to their meals or returned to their quarters, Iwent shooting over the ground they had left, and if I did not get abig bag of game, at any rate I made a good collection of drawings andmeasurements of the plans of the forts and emplacements which they hadtraced out on the ground.So that within a few days of their starting to make them we had theplans of them all in our possession. Although they afterwards plantedtrees all over the sites to conceal the forts within them, and put upbuildings in other places to hide them, we knew perfectly well wherethe emplacements were and what were their shapes and sizes.This planting of trees to hide such defence works occasionally hasthe other effect, and shows one where they are. This was notablythe case at Tsingtau, captured by the Japanese and British forcesfrom the Germans. As there were not any natural woods there, I hadlittle difficulty in finding where the forts were by reason of theplantations of recent growth in the neighbourhood of the place.RESIDENTIAL SPIES.These men take up their quarters more or less permanently in thecountry of their operations. A few are men in high places in thesocial or commercial world, and are generally _nouveaux riches_,anxious for decorations and rewards. But most of the residential spiesare of a more insignificant class, and in regular pay for their work.Their duty is to act as agents to receive and distribute instructionssecretly to other itinerant spies, and to return their reportsto headquarters. For this reason they are nicknamed in the GermanIntelligence Bureau "post-boxes." They also themselves pick up whatinformation they can from all available sources and transmit it home.One, Steinbauer, has for some years past been one of the principal"post-boxes" in England. He was attached to the Kaiser's staff duringhis last visit to this country, when he came as the guest of the Kingto the opening of Queen Victoria's memorial.A case of espionage which was tried in London revealed his methods,one of his agents being arrested after having been watched for threeyears.Karl Ernst's trial confirmed the discoveries and showed up the doingsof men spies like Schroeder, Gressa, Klare, and others.Also the case of Dr. Karl Graves may be still in the memory of many.This German was arrested in Scotland for spying, and was condemnedto eighteen months' imprisonment, and was shortly afterwards releasedwithout any reason being officially assigned. He has since writtena full account of what he did, and it is of interest to note how hiscorrespondence passed to and from the intelligence headquarters inGermany in envelopes embellished with the name of Messrs. Burroughsand Wellcome, the famous chemists. He posed as a doctor, and senthis letters through an innkeeper at Brussels or a _modiste_ in Paris,while letters to him came through an obscure tobacconist's shop inLondon.One of these letters miscarried through having the wrong initialto his name. It was returned by the Post Office to Burroughs andWellcome, who on opening it found inside a German letter, enclosingbank-notes in return for services rendered. This raised suspicionagainst him. He was watched, and finally arrested.He states that a feeling that he was being followed dawned upon himone day, when he noticed in his lodgings that the clothes which he hadfolded on a chair had been since refolded in a slightly different waywhile he was out. With some suspicion, he asked his landlady whetheranyone had entered his room, and she, in evident confusion, deniedthat any stranger could have been there. Then he suggested that histailor might have called, and she agreed that it was so. But when anhour or two later he interviewed his tailor, he, on his part, said hehad not been near the place. Graves consequently deduced that he wasbeing followed.The knowledge that you are being watched, and you don't know by whom,gives, I can assure you, a very jumpy feeling--especially when youknow you are guilty.I can speak feelingly from more than one experience of it, since Ihave myself been employed on this form of scouting in peace time.OFFICER AGENTS.It is generally difficult to find ordinary spies who are alsosufficiently imbued with technical knowledge to be of use in gainingnaval or military details. Consequently officers are often employedto obtain such information in peace time as well as in the theatre ofaction in war.But with them, and especially with those of Germany, it is not easy tofind men who are sufficiently good actors, or who can disguise theirappearance so well as to evade suspicion. Very many of these havevisited our shores during the past few years, but they have generallybeen noticed, watched, and followed, and from the line taken bythem in their reconnaissance it has been easy to deduce the kind ofoperations contemplated in their plans.I remember the case of a party of these motoring through Kentnominally looking at old Roman ruins. When they asked a landownerfor the exact position of some of these he regretted he had not amap handy on which he could point out their position. One of the"antiquarians" at once produced a large scale map; but it was notan English map: it had, for instance, details on it regarding watersupply tanks which, though they existed, were not shown on any of ourordnance maps!In addition to the various branches of spying which I have mentioned,the Germans have also practised commercial espionage on systematiclines.COMMERCIAL SPYING.Young Germans have been often known to serve in British businesshouses without salary in order to "learn the language"; they took careto learn a good deal more than the language, and picked up many otherthings about trade methods and secrets which were promptly utilisedin their own country. The importance of commercial spying is thatcommercial war is all the time at the bottom of Germany's preparationsfor military war.Carl Lody, a German ex-officer, was recently tried in London bycourt-martial and shot for "war treason"--that is, for sendinginformation regarding our Navy to Germany during hostilities. ("Wartreason" is secret work outside the zone of war operations. Whencarried on within the zone of operations it is called spying or"espionage.") Carl Lody's moves were watched and his correspondenceopened by the counter-spy police in London, and thus all hisinvestigations and information were known to the War Office longbefore he was arrested.The enormous sums paid by Germany for many years past have broughtabout a sort of international spy exchange, generally formed ofAmerican-Germans, with their headquarters in Belgium, and good priceswere given for information acquired by them. For instance, if theplans of a new fort, or the dimensions of a new ship, or the power ofa new gun were needed, one merely had to apply and state a price tothis bureau to receive fairly good information on the subject beforemuch time had elapsed.At the same time, by pretending to be an American, one was able to geta good deal of minor and useful information without the expenditure ofa cent.GERMANY'S INVASION PLANS.On getting into touch with these gentry, I was informed of one of theintended plans by which the Germans proposed to invade our country,and incidentally it throws some light on their present methodsof dealing with the inhabitants as apart from the actual tacticalmovements of the troops.The German idea then--some six years ago--was that they could, bymeans of mines and submarines, at any time block the traffic in theBritish Channel in the space of a few hours, thus holding our homefleets in their stations at Spithead and Portland.With the Straits of Dover so blocked, they could then rush a fleetof transports across the North Sea from Germany, to the East Coast ofEngland, either East Anglia or, as in this plan, in Yorkshire. Theyhad in Germany nine embarking stations, with piers and platforms,all ready made, and steel lighters for disembarkation purposes or foractual traversing of the ocean in case of fine weather.They had taken the average of the weather for years past, and had cometo the conclusion that July 13th is, on an average, the finest dayin the year; but their attempt would be timed, if possible, to fallon a Bank Holiday when communications were temporarily disorganised.Therefore the nearest Bank Holiday to July 13th would probably be thatat the beginning of August; it was a coincidence that the present warbroke out on that day.The spies stationed in England were to cut all telephone and telegraphwires, and, where possible, to blow down important bridges andtunnels, and thus to interrupt communications and create confusion.Their idea of landing on the coast of Yorkshire was based on thefollowing reasons:--They do not look upon London as strategically the capital of England,but rather upon the great industrial centres of the north Midlands,where, instead of six millions, there are more like fourteen millionsof people assembled in the numerous cities and towns, which now almostadjoin each other across that part of the country.Their theory was that if they could rush an army of even 90,000 meninto Leeds, Sheffield, Halifax, Manchester, and Liverpool withoutencountering great opposition in the first few hours, they could thereestablish themselves in such strength that it would require a powerfularmy to drive them out again.Bringing a week's provisions with them, and seizing all the localprovisions, they would have enough to sustain them for a considerabletime, and the first step of their occupation would be to expel everyinhabitant--man, woman, and child--from the neighbourhood and destroythe towns. Thus, within a few hours, some fourteen millions of peoplewould be starving, and wandering without shelter over the face of thecountry--a disaster which would need a large force to deal with, andwould cause entire disruption of our food supplies and of business inthe country.The East Coast of Yorkshire between the Humber and Scarborough lendsitself to such an adventure, by providing a good open beach for miles,with open country in front of it, which, in its turn, is protectedby a semi-circle of wolds, which could be easily held by the Germancovering force. Its left would be protected by the Humber and theright by the Tees, so that the landing could be carried out withoutinterruption.That was their plan--based on careful investigation by a small armyof spies--some five or six years ago, before our naval bases had beenestablished in the north. If they had declared war then, they, mighthave had no serious interference from our Navy during the passage oftheir transports, which, of course, would be protected on that flankby their entire fleet of warships.At first glance, it seems too fanciful a plan to commend itself tobelief, but in talking it over with German officers, I found theyfully believed in it as a practical proposition. They themselvesenlarged on the idea of the use that they would thus make of the civilpopulation, and foreshadowed their present brutality by explainingthat when war came, it would not be made with kid gloves. The meaningof their commands would be brought home to the people by shooting downcivilians if necessary, in order to prove that they were in earnest,and to force the inhabitants through terror to comply with theirrequirements.Further investigations on the subject proved that the embarkationarrangements were all planned and prepared for. At any time in theordinary way of commerce there were numerous large mail steamersalways available in their ports to transport numbers even largely inexcess of those that would be assembled for such an expedition. Troopscould be mobilised in the neighbourhood of the ports, ostensibly formanoeuvres, without suspicion being aroused.It is laid down in German strategical textbooks that the time formaking war is not when you have a political cause for it, but whenyour troops are ready and the enemy is unready; and that to strike thefirst blow is the best way to declare war.I recounted all this at the time in a private lecture to officers,illustrated with lantern slides and maps, as a military problem whichwould be interesting to work out on the actual ground, and it was notreally until the report of this leaked into the papers that I realisedhow nearly I had "touched the spot." For, apart from the variousindignant questions with which the Secretary of State for War wasbadgered in the House of Commons on my account, I was assailed withletters from Germany of most violent abuse from various quarters, highand low, which showed me that I had gone nearer the truth than I hadeven suspected."You are but a brown-paper general," said one, "and if you think thatby your foolish talk you are to frighten us from coming, you are notright."FIELD SPIES.It is difficult to say where exactly a spy's work ends in war, andthat of a scout begins, except that, as a rule, the first is carriedout in disguise.The scout is looked up to as a brave man, and his expedients forgaining information are thought wonderfully clever, so long as heremains in uniform. If he goes a bit further, and finds that he canget his information better by adopting a disguise--even at the greaterrisk to himself through the certainty of being shot if he is foundout--then he is looked down upon as a "despicable spy." I don't seethe justice of it myself.A good spy--no matter which country he serves--is _of necessity_ abrave and valuable fellow.In our Army we do not make a very wide use of field spies on service,though their partial use at manoeuvres has shown what they can do.In "Aids to Scouting" I have stated: "In the matter of spying weare behind other nations. Spying, in reality, is reconnaissance indisguise. Its effects are so far-reaching that most nations, in orderto deter enemies' spies, threaten them with death if caught."As an essential part of scouting, I gave a chapter of hints on how tospy, and how to catch other people spying.CATCHING A SPY.Spy-catching was once one of my duties, and is perhaps the best formof education towards successful spying. I had been lucky enough tonail three and was complimented by one of the senior officers on theCommander-in-Chief's staff. We were riding home together from a bigreview at the time that he was talking about it, and he remarked, "Howdo you set about catching a spy?" I told him of our methods and addedthat also luck very often came in and helped one.Just in front of us, in the crowd of vehicles returning fromthe review-ground, was an open hired Victoria in which sat aforeign-looking gentleman. I remarked that as an instance this was thesort of man I should keep an eye upon, and I should quietly follow himtill I found where he lodged and then put a detective on to report hismoves.From our position on horseback close behind him we were able to seethat our foreigner was reading a guide book and was studying a map ofthe fortifications through which we were passing. Suddenly he calledto the driver to stop for a moment while he lit a match for hiscigarette. The driver pulled up, and so did we. The stranger glancedup to see that the man was not looking round, and then quickly slippeda camera from under the rug which was lying on the seat in front ofhim, and taking aim at the entrance shaft of a new ammunition storewhich had just been made for our Navy, he took a snapshot.Then hurriedly covering up the camera again he proceeded to strikematches and to light his cigarette. Then he gave the word to drive onagain.We followed close behind till we came to where a policeman wasregulating the traffic. I rode ahead and gave him his instructionsso that the carriage was stopped, and the man was asked to show hispermit to take photographs. He had none. The camera was taken intocustody and the name and address of the owner taken "with a view tofurther proceedings."Unfortunately at that time--it was many years ago--we were badlyhandicapped by our laws in the matter of arresting and punishingspies. By-laws allowed us to confiscate and smash unauthorisedcameras, and that was all."Further proceedings," had they been possible, in this case would havebeen unnecessary, for the suspected gentleman took himself off to theContinent by the very next boat.But it took a good deal to persuade my staff-officer friend that thewhole episode was not one faked up for his special edification.It is only human to hate to be outwitted by one more clever thanyourself, and perhaps that accounts for people disliking spies witha more deadly hatred than that which they bestow on a man who dropsbombs from an aeroplane indiscriminately on women and children, or whobombards cathedrals with infernal engines of war.Nobody could say that my native spy in South Africa, Jan Grootboom,was either a contemptible or mean kind of man. He was described by onewho knew him as a "white man in a black skin," and I heartily endorsethe description.Here is an instance of his work as a field spy:--Jan Grootboom was a Zulu by birth, but having lived much with whitemen, as a hunter and guide, he had taken to wearing ordinary clothesand spoke English perfectly well: but within him he had all the pluckand cunning of his race.For scouting against the Matabele it was never wise to take a largeparty, since it would be sure to attract attention, whereas by goingalone with one man, such as Grootboom, one was able to penetrate theirlines and to lie hid almost among them, watching their disposition andgaining information as to their numbers, supplies, and whereabouts oftheir women and cattle, etc.Now, every night was spent at this work--that is to say, the night wasutilised for creeping to their positions, and one watched them duringthe day. But it was impossible to do this without leaving footmarksand tracks, which the sharp eyes of their scouts were not slow todiscover, and it very soon dawned upon them that they were beingwatched, and consequently they were continually on the look-out towaylay and capture us.One night Grootboom and I had ridden to the neighbourhood of one ofthe enemy's camps, and were lying waiting for the early dawn before wecould discover exactly where they were located.It was during the hour before sunrise that, as a rule, the enemy usedto light their fires for cooking their early morning food. One couldthus see exactly their position, and could rectify one's own, so asto find a place where one could lie by during the day and watch theirmovements.On this occasion the first fire was lit and then another sparkled up,and yet another, but before half a dozen had been lighted Grootboomsuddenly growled under his breath:--"The swine--they are laying a trap for us."I did not understand at the moment what he meant, but he said:--"Stop here for a bit, and I will go and look."He slipped off all his clothing and left it lying in a heap, and stoleaway in the darkness, practically naked. Evidently he was going tovisit them to see what was going on.The worst of spying is that it makes you always suspicious, even ofyour best friends. So, as soon as Grootboom was gone in one direction,I quietly crept away in another, and got among some rocks in asmall kopje, where I should have some kind of a chance if he had anyintention of betraying me and returning with a few Matabele to captureme.For an hour or two I lay there, until presently I saw Grootboomcreeping back through the grass--alone.Ashamed of my doubts, I therefore came out and went to our rendezvous,and found him grinning all over with satisfaction while he was puttingon his clothes again. He said that he had found as he had expected,an ambush laid for us. The thing that had made him suspicious was thatthe fires, instead of lighting up all over the hillside at differentpoints about the same time, had been lighted in steady succession oneafter another, evidently by one man going round. This struck him assuspicious, and he then assumed that it was done to lead us on, if wewere anywhere around, to go and examine more closely the locality.He had crept in towards them by a devious path, from which he was ableto perceive a whole party of the Matabele lying low in the grass bythe track which we should probably have used in getting there, andthey would have pounced upon us and captured us.To make sure of this suspicion he crept round till near theirstronghold, and coming from there he got in among them and chattedaway with them, finding out what was their intention with regard toourselves, and also what were their plans for the near future. Then,having left them, and walked boldly back towards their stronghold, hecrept away amongst some rocks and rejoined me.His was an example of the work of a field spy which, although in a wayit may be cunning and deceitful, at the same time demands the greatestpersonal courage and astuteness. It is something greater than theordinary bravery of a soldier in action, who is carried on by theenthusiasm of those around him under the leadership of an officer, andwith the competition and admiration of others.The pluck of the man who goes out alone, unobserved and unapplauded,and at the risk of his life, is surely equally great.The Boers used field spies freely against us in South Africa.One English-speaking Boer used to boast how, during the war, he madefrequent visits to Johannesburg dressed in the uniform taken from aBritish major who had been killed in action. He used to ride pastthe sentries, who, instead of shooting him, merely saluted, and hefrequented the clubs and other resorts of the officers, picking upsuch information as he required from them first hand, till eveningcame and he was able to ride back to his commando.CONVEYING INFORMATION.On our side various methods were adopted of conveying informationin the field. My spies employed native runners (especially the mostastute cattle-thieves) to take their despatches to me._A SECRET MESSAGE._[Illustration: _These hieroglyphics contain a secret message whichcan be easily read by those who know the semaphore signalling code.This signalling consists of swinging two arms in different positions,either singly or together. The dots indicate where the letters join.For example: The semaphore sign for N consists of both arms pointingdownwards at an angle of 90 degrees ^. The letter I is shown by botharms pointing to the left at the same angle >. The next N is shownagain, and the letter E is a single arm pointing upwards on the rightat an angle of 45 degrees /.__In each word you start at the top of the signs and read downwards.__This form of secret message was frequently used in the South AfricanWar._]These were in every case naturally written in cypher or secret code,in Hindustani written in English characters, and so on. They wererolled up into pellets and pressed into a small hole bored in awalking-stick, the hole being then plugged with clay or soap. Or theywere put into the bowl of a pipe underneath the tobacco, and couldthus be burnt without suspicion if necessary, or they were slippedin between the soles of the boots, or stitched in the lining of thebearer's clothing. These natives also understood the language ofsmoke-fires--signalling by means of little or big puffs of smoke as tothe enemy's moves and strength.SECRET SIGNALS AND WARNINGS.The native despatch-runners whom we sent out to make their way throughthe enemy's lines carried the letters tightly rolled up in littleballs, coated with sheet lead, such as tea is packed in.These little balls they carried slung round their necks on a string.The moment that they saw an enemy coming near they dropped theballs, which then looked like so many stones, on the ground, and tookbearings of the spot so that they could find them again when the coastwas clear.Then there were fixed points for hiding letters for other spies tofind. Here are some of the most frequently used:[Illustration: _This little mark, scratched on the ground or on a treetrunk or gate-post, was used by one scout for the information ofanother. It means: "A letter is hidden four paces in this direction."_[Illustration: _A sign used to warn another scout that he is followinga wrong direction. It means: "Not this way."_][Illustration: _This is another sign from one scout to another andmeans: "I have returned home."_][Illustration: _The "blaze" on the tree trunk and the two stones, oneon the other, are simply to show that the scout is on the right trail.__The other three sketches are to show the direction in which the scoutshould go. The arrow is marked on the ground. The upper part of thesapling or bush is bent over in the direction which the scout shouldtake, and the same is the case with the bunch of grass, which is firstof all knotted and then bent._]SPIES IN WAR TIME.The Japanese, of course, in their war with Russia in Manchuria madeextensive use of spies, and Port Arthur, with all its defects offortification and equipment, was known thoroughly inside and out tothe Japanese general staff before they ever fired a shot at it.In the field service regulations of the German army a paragraphdirected that the service of protection in the field--that is tosay, outposts, advanced guards, and reconnaissances--should always beassisted by a system of spying, and although this paragraph no longerstands in the book, the spirit of it is none the less carried out.The field spies are a recognised and efficient arm.Frederick the Great is recorded to have said: "When Marshal Subisegoes to war, he is followed by a hundred cooks, but when I take thefield I am preceded by a hundred spies."The present leader of the German army might well say the same, thoughprobably his "hundred" would amount to thousands.We hear of them dressed in plain clothes as peasants, and signallingwith coloured lights, with puffs of smoke from chimneys, and by usingthe church clock hands as semaphores.Very frequently a priest was arrested and found to be a spy disguised,and as such he was shot. Also a German chauffeur in a French uniform,who had for some time been driving French staff officers about, wasfound to be a spy, and so met his death.Early in the present war the German field spies had their secret codeof signs, so that by drawing sketches of cattle of different coloursand sizes on gates, etc., they conveyed information to each other ofthe strength and direction of different bodies of hostile troops inthe neighbourhood.As a rule, these are residential spies, who have lived for months oryears as small tradesmen, etc., in the towns and villages now includedin the theatre of war. On the arrival of the German invaders theyhave chalked on their doors, "Not to be destroyed. Good people here,"and have done it for some of their neighbours also in order to divertsuspicion. In their capacity of naturalised inhabitants they are inposition, of course, to gain valuable tactical information for thecommanders of the troops. And their different ways of communicating itare more than ingenious.In some cases both spies and commanders have maps ruled off in smallsquares. The watchful spy signals to his commander, "Enemy's cavalryhalted behind wood in square E15," and very soon a salvo of shellsvisits this spot. A woman spy was caught signalling with an electricflash lamp. Two different men (one of them an old one-leggedstonebreaker at the roadside) were caught with field telephones hiddenon them with wire coiled round their bodies. Shepherds with lanternswent about on the downs at night dodging the lanterns about in variousways which did not seem altogether necessary for finding sheep.Wireless telegraphs were set up to look like supports to ironchimneys.In the South African Campaign a Dutch stationmaster acted as fieldspy for the Boers for a short time. It was only a very short time. Histown and station were captured by my force, and, in order to divertsuspicion, he cut and pulled down the telegraph wires, all exceptone, which was left in working order. By this wire he sent to the Boerheadquarters all the information he could get about our forces andplans. Unfortunately, we had a party of men tapping the wire, and wereable to read all his messages, and to confront him with them shortlyafterwards.Another stationmaster, in our own territory, acted as spy to the enemybefore the war began by employing enemies as gangers and platelayersalong the line with a view to the destruction of bridges and culvertsas soon as war was declared. There was also found in his office a codeby which the different arms of the service were designated in terms oftimber for secretly telegraphing information. Thus:  Beams     meant   Brigades  Timbers     "     Batteries  Logs        "     Guns  Scantlings  "     Battalions  Joists      "     Squadrons  Planks      "     CompaniesTHE PLUCK OF A SPY.Except in the case of the traitor spy, one does not quite understandwhy a spy should necessarily be treated worse than any othercombatant, nor why his occupation should be looked upon ascontemptible, for, whether in peace or war, his work is of a veryexacting and dangerous kind. It is intensely exciting, and though insome cases it brings a big reward, the best spies are unpaid men whoare doing it for the love of the thing, and as a really effective stepto gaining something valuable for their country and for their side.The plea put forward by the German spy, Lieut. Carl Lody, at hiscourt-martial in London, was that "he would not cringe for mercy. Hewas not ashamed of anything that he had done; he was in honour boundnot to give away the names of those who had employed him on thismission; he was not paid for it, he did it for his country's good,and he knew that he carried his life in his hands in doing so. Many aBriton was probably doing the same for Britain."He was even spoken of in our House of Commons as being "a patriotwho had died for his country as much as any soldier who fell in thefield."To be a really effective spy, a man has to be endowed with a strongspirit of self-sacrifice, courage, and self-control, with the powerof acting a part, quick at observation and deduction, and blessedwith good health and nerve of exceptional quality. A certain amount ofscientific training is of value where a man has to be able to take theangles of a fort, or to establish the geological formation, say, ofthe middle island under the Forth Bridge, which was shown by Graves tobe readily adaptable for explosion purposes.For anyone who is tired of life, the thrilling life of a spy should bethe very finest recuperator!TRAITOROUS SPYING.Quite another class of spy is the traitor who gives away thesecrets of his own country. For him, of course, there is no excuse.Fortunately, the Briton is not as a rule of a corruptible character,and many foreign spies in England have been discovered through theirattempts to bribe officers or men to give away secrets.On the other hand, we hear frequently of foreign soldiers fallingvictims to such temptation, and eventually being discovered. Caseshave only recently come to light in Austria where officers werewilling to sell information as regards a number of secret block-houseswhich were built on the frontier of Bukovina last year. Details ofthem got into the hands of another Power within a few days of thedesigns being made.Apparently when suspicion falls upon an officer in Austria the caseis not tried in public, but is conducted privately, sometimes by theEmperor himself. When the man is found guilty, the procedure is forfour friends of the accused to visit him and tell him what has beendiscovered against him, and to present him with a loaded revolver andleave him. They then remain watching the house, in order that he shallnot escape, and until he elects to shoot himself; if he fails to doso, in reasonable time, they go in and finish him off between them.THE GERMAN SPY ORGANISATION.The espionage system of the Germans far exceeds that of any othercountry in its extent, cost, and organisation. It was thoroughlyexposed after the war with France in 1870, when it was definitelyshown that the German Government had an organisation of over 20,000paid informers stationed in France, and controlled by one man,Stieber, for both political and military purposes.To such completeness were their machinations carried that when JulesFavre came to Versailles to treat about the surrender of Paris withthe headquarter staff of the German army he was met at the stationby a carriage, of which the coachman was a German spy, and was takento lodge in the house which was the actual headquarters of the spydepartment. Stieber himself was the valet, recommended to him as"a thoroughly trustworthy servant." Stieber availed himself of hisposition to go through his master's pockets and despatch cases daily,collecting most valuable data and information for Bismarck.Somehow, on the surface, suspicion of the German spy methods seemedto have subsided since that date, although at the time widely knownthroughout Europe. But their methods have been steadily elaborated andcarried into practice ever since, not in France alone, but in all thecountries on the Continent, and also in Great Britain.THE VALUE OF BEING STUPID.Fortunately for us, we are as a nation considered by the others to beabnormally stupid, therefore easily to be spied upon. But it is notalways safe to judge entirely by appearances.Our Ambassador at Constantinople some years ago had the appearance ofa cheery, bluff, British farmer, with nothing below the surface inhis character, and he was therefore looked upon as fair game by allhis intriguing rivals in Eastern politics. It was only after repeatedfailures of their different missions they found that in every casethey were out-intrigued by this innocent-looking gentleman, who belowthe surface was as cunning as a fox and as clever a diplomat as couldbe found in all the service.And so it has been with us British. Foreign spies stationed in ourcountry saw no difficulty in completely hoodwinking so stupid apeople; they never supposed that the majority of them have all beenknown to our Secret Service Department, and carefully watched, unknownto themselves.Few of them ever landed in this country without undergoing thescrutiny of an unobtrusive little old gentleman with tall hat andumbrella, but the wag of whose finger sent a detective on the heelsof the visitor until his actual business and location were assured andfound to be satisfactory.For years the correspondence of these gentry has been regularlyopened, noted, and sent on. They were not as a rule worth arresting,the information sent was not of any urgent importance, and so longas they went on thinking that they were unnoticed, their superiorsin their own country made no effort to send more astute men in theirplace. Thus we knew what the enemy were looking for, and we knew whatinformation they had received, and this as a rule was not of muchaccount.On August 4th, the day before the declaration of war, the twentyleading spies were formally arrested and over 200 of their minoragents were also taken in hand, and thus their organisation failedthem at the moment when it was wanted most. Steps were also takento prevent any substitutes being appointed in their places. Privatewireless stations were dismantled, and by means of traps those werediscovered which had not been voluntarily reported and registered.It used to amuse some of us to watch the foreign spies at work on ourground. One especially interested me, who set himself up ostensibly asa coal merchant, but never dealt in a single ounce of coal. His dailyreconnaissance of the country, his noting of the roads, and his othermovements entailed in preparing his reports, were all watched andrecorded. His letters were opened in the post, sealed up, and sent on.His friends were observed and shadowed on arriving--as they did--atHull instead of in London. And all the time he was plodding along,wasting his time, quite innocent of the fact that he was beingwatched, and was incidentally giving us a fine amount of information.Another came only for a few hours, and was away again before we couldcollar him; but, knowing his moves, and what photographs he had taken,I was able to write to him, and tell him that had I known beforehandthat he wished to photograph these places, I could have suppliedhim with some ready made, as the forts which they recorded were nowobsolete.On the other hand, the exceedingly stupid Englishmen who wanderedabout foreign countries sketching cathedrals, or catching butterflies,or fishing for trout, were merely laughed at as harmless lunatics.These have even invited officials to look at their sketch-books,which, had they had any suspicion or any eyes in their heads, wouldhave revealed plans and armaments of their own fortresses interpolatedamong the veins of the botanist's drawings of leaves or on thebutterflies' wings of the entomologist. Some examples of secretsketches of fortresses which have been used with success are shown onthe following pages.[Illustration: _This sketch of a butterfly contains the outline of afortress, and marks both the position and power of the guns. The markson the wings between the lines mean nothing, but those on the linesshow the nature and size of the guns, according to the keys below._][Illustration: The marks on the wings reveal the shape of the fortressshown here and the size of the guns.  [Illustration: FORTRESS GUNS.]  [Illustration: FIELD GUNS.]  [Illustration: MACHINE GUNS.]_The position of each gun is at the place inside the outline of thefort on the butterfly where the line marked with the spot ends.

Ithen decided to bury it in such a way that it could not be recognisedas a fortress plan if I were caught by the military authorities.One idea which occurred to me was to make it into the doorway of acathedral or church, but I finally decided on the sketch of the moth'shead. Underneath in my note-book I wrote the following words:--_    "_Head of Dula moth as seen through a magnifying glass. Caught    19.5.12. Magnified about six times size of life." (Meaning    scale of 6 inches to the mile.)_]BUTTERFLY HUNTING IN DALMATIA.Once I went "butterfly hunting" in Dalmatia. Cattaro, the capital, hasbeen the scene of much bombarding during the present war.More than a hundred years ago it was bombarded by the British fleetand taken. It was then supposed to be impregnable. It lies at the headof a loch some fifteen miles long, and in some parts but a few hundredyards wide, in a trough between mountains. From Cattaro, at thehead of the loch, a zig-zag road leads up the mountain side over thefrontier into Montenegro.When the British ships endeavoured to attack from the seaward,the channel was closed by chains and booms put across it. But thedefenders had reckoned without the resourcefulness of the British"handyman," and a few days later, to the utter astonishment of thegarrison, guns began to bombard them from the top of a neighbouringmountain!The British captain had landed his guns on the Adriatic shore, and bymeans of timber slides rigged up on the mountain side he had hauledhis guns bodily up the rocky steeps to the very summit of themountain.He fixed up his batteries, and was eventually able to bombard the townwith such effect that it had to surrender.It was perhaps characteristic of us that we only took the town becauseit was held by our enemies. We did not want it, and when we had gotit we did not know what to do with it. We therefore handed it over tothe Montenegrins, and thus gave them a seaport of their own. For thisfeat the Montenegrins have always had a feeling of admiration and ofgratitude to the British, and, though by terms of ulterior treatiesit was eventually handed over to Dalmatia, the Montenegrins have neverforgotten our goodwill towards them on this occasion.But other batteries have since been built upon these mountain tops,and it was my business to investigate their positions, strength, andarmaments.I went armed with most effective weapons for the purpose, which haveserved me well in many a similar campaign. I took a sketch-book,in which were numerous pictures--some finished, others only partlydone--of butterflies of every degree and rank, from a "Red Admiral" toa "Painted Lady."Carrying this book and a colour-box, and a butterfly net in my hand,I was above all suspicion to anyone who met me on the lonely mountainside, even in the neighbourhood of the forts.I was hunting butterflies, and it was always a good introductionwith which to go to anyone who was watching me with suspicion. Quitefrankly, with my sketch-book in hand, I would ask innocently whetherhe had seen such-and-such a butterfly in the neighbourhood, as I wasanxious to catch one. Ninety-nine out of a hundred did not know onebutterfly from another--any more than I do--so one was on fairlysafe ground in that way, and they thoroughly sympathised with the madEnglishman who was hunting these insects.They did not look sufficiently closely into the sketches ofbutterflies to notice that the delicately drawn veins of the wingswere exact representations, in plan, of their own fort, and that thespots on the wings denoted the number and position of guns and theirdifferent calibres.On another occasion I found it a simple disguise to go as a fishermaninto the country which I wanted to examine.My business was to find some passes in the mountains, and reportwhether they were feasible for the passage of troops. I thereforewandered up the various streams which led over the hills, andby quietly fishing about I was able to make surveys of the wholeneighbourhood.But on one occasion a countryman constituted himself my guide, andinsisted on sticking to me all the morning, showing me places wherefish could be caught. I was not, as a matter of fact, much of afisherman at that time, nor had I any desire to catch fish, and mytackle was of a very ramshackle description for the purpose.I flogged the water assiduously with an impossible fly, just to keepthe man's attention from my real work, in the hope that he wouldeventually get tired of it and go away. But not he! He watched me withthe greatest interest for a long time, and eventually explained thathe did not know anything about fly fishing, but had a much bettersystem of getting the fish together before casting a worm orslug-among-them.His system he then proceeded to demonstrate, which was to spit intothe water. This certainly attracted a run of fish, and then he saidthat if only he had a worm he could catch any number.I eventually got rid of him by sending him to procure such, and whilehe was away I made myself scarce and clambered over the ridge toanother valley.HOW SPIES DISGUISE THEMSELVES.Spying brings with it a constant wearing strain of nerves and mind,seeing that it involves certain death for a false step in war orimprisonment in peace. The Government promises to give no helpwhatever to its servant if caught. He is warned to keep no notes, toconfide in no one, to use disguises where necessary, and to shift forhimself entirely.[Illustration: _The matter of disguise is not so much one oftheatrical make-up as of being able to secure a totally differentcharacter in voice and mannerisms, and especially of gait in walkingand appearance from behind. A man may effect a wonderful disguise infront, yet be instantly recognised by a keen eye from behind. This isa point which is frequently forgotten by beginners, and yet is oneof the most important. The first and third figures show an effectivemake-up in front, but the second figure, a back-view, shows how easilythe man may be recognised by a person behind him. The fourth and fifthsketches show, by means of dotted lines, how the "back-view" can bealtered by change of clothing and gait._]The matter of disguise is not so much one of a theatricalmake-up--although this is undoubtedly a useful art--as of beingable to assume a totally different character, change of voice andmannerisms, especially of gait in walking and appearance from behind.This point is so often forgotten by beginners, and yet it is one ofthe most important.I was at one time watched by a detective who one day was asoldierly-looking fellow and the next an invalid with a patch overhis eye. I could not believe it was the same man until I watched himfrom behind and saw him walking, when at once his individuality wasapparent.For mannerisms, a spy has by practice to be able to show an impedimentin his speech one day, whereas the next a wiggle of an eyelid or asnuffling at the nose will make him appear a totally different being.For a quick change, it is wonderful what difference is made by merelyaltering your hat and necktie. It is usual for a person addressinganother to take note of his necktie, and probably of his hat, if ofnothing else, and thus it is often useful to carry a necktie and acap of totally different hue from that which you are wearing, ready tochange immediately in order to escape recognition a few minutes later.[Illustration: _This illustration shows how the writer was able todisguise himself at very short notice when he observed that he wasrecognised on a railway station. The first sketch shows him as heentered a waiting-room shortly after his suspicions were aroused.The second depicts him on his exit a few minutes later. The disguise,simple though it may seem, was entirely successful._]I learnt this incidentally through being interviewed some years ago ata railway station. A few minutes after the ordeal I found myself closeup to my interviewer, when he was re-telling the incident to a brotherjournalist, who was also eager to find me. "He is down there, in oneof the last carriages of the train. You will know him at once; he iswearing a green Homburg hat and a red tie, and a black coat."Fortunately I had a grey overcoat on my arm, in which was a travellingcap and a comforter. Diving into the waiting-room, I effected a "quickchange" into these, crammed my hat into my pocket, and tottered back,with an invalid shuffle, to my carriage. I re-entered it under thenose of the waiting reporter without being suspected, and presentlyhad the pleasure of being carried away before him unassailed.On a recent occasion in my knowledge a man was hunted down into a backstreet which was a _cul-de-sac_, with no exit from it. He turned intothe door of a warehouse and went up some flights of stairs, hoping tofind a refuge, but, finding none, he turned back and came down againand faced the crowd which was waiting outside, uncertain which househe had entered.By assuming extreme lameness in one leg, hunching up one shoulder,and jamming his hat down over a distorted-looking face, he was ableto limp boldly down among them without one of them suspecting hisindividuality.In regard to disguises, hair on the face--such as moustache orbeard--are very usually resorted to for altering a man's appearancebut these are perfectly useless in the eye of a trained detectiveunless the eyebrows also are changed in some way.[Illustration: _Another instance of how an effective disguise can beassumed on the spur of the moment. This disguise was effected in twominutes._][Illustration: _The use of hair in disguising the face is perfectlyuseless unless the eyebrows are considerably changed. The brow and theback of the head are also extremely important factors in the art ofdisguise.__The second picture shows the effect of "improving" the eyebrows ofthe face on the left, and also of raising the hair on the brow, whilethe third sketch shows what a difference the addition of a beard andextra hair on the back of the head, can make._]I remember meeting a man on the veldt in South Africa bronzed andbearded, who came to me and said that he had been at school with oneof my name. As he thrust his hat back on his head I at once recognisedthe brow which I had last seen at Charterhouse some twenty-five yearsbefore, and the name and nickname at once sprang to my lips. "Why, youare Liar Jones," I exclaimed. He said, "My name is Jones, but I wasnot aware of the 'Liar.'""In altering your face you must remember that 'improved' eyebrowsalter the expression of the face more than any beards, shaving, etc.Tattoo marks can be painted on the hands or arms, to be washed offwhen you change your disguise.... Disguising by beginners is almostinvariably overdone in front and not enough behind.... Beforeattempting to be a spy first set yourself to catch a spy, and thuslearn what faults to avoid as likely to give you away." [_Aids toScouting_, p. 136.]It fell to my lot at one time to live as a plumber in South-eastLondon, and I grew a small "goatee" beard, which was rather in vogueamongst men of that class at that time.One day, in walking past the Naval and Military Club in Piccadillyin my workman's get-up, I passed an old friend, a major in theHorse Artillery, and almost without thinking I accosted him by hisregimental nickname. He stared and wondered, and then supposed that Ihad been a man in his battery, and could not believe his eyes when Irevealed my identity.I was never suspected by those among whom I went, and with whom Ibecame intimate. I had nominally injured my arm in an accident andcarried it in a sling, and was thus unable to work, or what was also ablessing, to join in fights in which my friends from time to time gotinvolved. My special companion was one Jim Bates, a carpenter. I lostsight of him for some years, and when next I met him he was one of thecrowd at a review at Aldershot, where I was in full rig as an Hussarofficer. It was difficult to persuade him that I was his former friendthe plumber.Later on, when employed on a reconnaissance mission in South Africa,I had grown a red beard to an extent that would have disguised me frommy own mother. Coming out of the post office of a small country town,to my surprise I came up against the Colonel of my regiment, who wasthere for an outing. I at once--forgetting my disguise--accosted himwith a cheery "Hullo, Colonel, I didn't know you were here," andhe turned on me and stared for a minute or two, and then respondedhuffily that he did not know who I was. As he did not appear to wantto, I went my ways, and only reminded him months later of our briefmeeting!THE SPORT OF SPYING.Undoubtedly spying would be an intensely interesting sport even if nogreat results were obtainable from it. There is a fascination whichgets hold of anyone who has tried the art. Each day brings freshsituations and conditions requiring quick change of action andoriginality to meet them.Here are a few instances from actual experiences. None of these areanything out of the common, but are merely the everyday doings of theaverage agent, but they may best explain the sporting value of thework.One of the attractive features of the life of a spy is that he has,on occasion, to be a veritable Sherlock Holmes. He has to notice thesmallest of details, points which would probably escape the untrainedeye, and then he has to put this and that together and deduce ameaning from them.I remember once when carrying out a secret reconnaissance in SouthAfrica I came across a farmhouse from which the owner was absent atthe moment of my arrival. I had come far and would have still furtherto go before I came across any habitation, and I was hard up for alodging for the night.After off-saddling and knee-haltering my horse, I looked into thevarious rooms to see what sort of a man was the inhabitant. It neededonly a glance into his bedroom in this ramshackle hut to see that hewas one of the right sort, for there, in a glass on the window-sill,were two tooth-brushes.I argued that he was an Englishman and of cleanly habits, and would dofor me as a host--and I was not mistaken in the result!THE VALUE OF HIDE-AND-SEEK.The game of Hide-and-Seek is really one of the best games for a boy,and can be elaborated until it becomes scouting in the field. Itteaches you a lot.I was strongly addicted to it as a child, and the craft learned inthat innocent field of sport has stood me in good stead in many acritical time since. To lie flat in a furrow among the currant busheswhen I had not time to reach the neighbouring box bushes beforethe pursuer came in sight taught me the value of not using the mostobvious cover, since it would at once be searched. The hunters went atonce to the box bushes as the likely spot, while I could watch theirdoings from among the stems of the currant bushes.Often I have seen hostile scouts searching the obvious bits of cover,but they did not find _me_ there; and, like the elephant hunter amongthe fern trees, or a boar in a cotton crop, so a boy in the currantbushes is invisible to the enemy, while he can watch every move of theenemy's legs.This I found of value when I came to be pursued by mounted militarypolice, who suspected me of being a spy at some manoeuvres abroad.After a rare chase I scrambled over a wall and dropped into an orchardof low fruit trees. Here squatting in a ditch, I watched the legs ofthe gendarmes' horses while they quartered the plantation, and whenthey drew away from me I crept to the bank of a deep water channelwhich formed one of the boundaries of the enclosure. Here I founda small plank bridge by which I could cross, but before doing so Iloosened the near end, and passed over, dragging the plank after me.On the far side the country was open, and before I had gone far thegendarmes spied me, and after a hurried consultation, dashed off ata gallop for the nearest bridge, half a mile away. I promptly turnedback, replaced my bridge and recrossed the stream, throwing the plankinto the river, and made my way past the village to the next stationdown the line while the horsemen were still hunting for me in thewrong place.Another secret that one picked up at the game of Hide-and-Seek was,if possible, to get above the level of the hunter's eye, and to"freeze"--that is, to sit tight without a movement, and, although notin actual concealment, you are very apt to escape notice by so doing.I found it out long ago by lying flat along the top of an ivy-cladwall when my pursuers passed within a few feet of me without lookingup at me. I put it to the proof later on by sitting on a bank besidethe road, just above the height of a man, but so near that I mighthave touched a passer-by with a fishing-rod; and there I sat withoutany concealment and counted fifty-four wayfarers, out of whom no morethan eleven noticed me.The knowledge of this fact came in useful on one of my investigatingtours. Inside a great high wall lay a dockyard in which, it wasrumoured, a new power-house was being erected, and possibly a dry dockwas in course of preparation.It was early morning; the gates were just opened; the workmen werebeginning to arrive, and several carts of materials were waiting tocome in. Seizing the opportunity of the gates being open, I gave ahurried glance in, as any ordinary passer-by might do. I was promptlyejected by the policeman on duty in the lodge.I did not go far. My intention was to get inside somehow and to seewhat I could. I watched the first of the carts go in, and noticed thatthe policeman was busily engaged in talking to the leading wagoner,while the second began to pass through the gate. In a moment I jumpedalongside it on the side opposite to the janitor, and so passed in andcontinued to walk with the vehicle as it turned to the right and woundits way round the new building in course of construction.I then noticed another policeman ahead of me and so I kept my positionby the cart, readapting its cover in order to avoid him. Unfortunatelyin rounding the corner I was spied by the first policeman, and heimmediately began to shout to me (_see map_). I was deaf to hisremarks and walked on as unconcernedly as a guilty being could tillI placed the corner of the new building between him and me. Then Ifairly hooked it along the back of the building and rounded the farcorner of it. As I did so I saw out of the tail of my eye that he wascoming full speed after me and was calling policeman No. 2 to his aid.I darted like a red-shank round the next corner out of sight of bothpolicemen, and looked for a method of escape.[Illustration: _The dotted line in this plan shows my route, smallfigures are policemen looking for me._]The scaffolding of the new house towered above me, and a ladder ledupwards on to it. Up this I went like a lamplighter, keeping one eyeon the corner of the building lest I should be followed.I was half-way up when round the corner came one of the policemen.I at once "froze." I was about fifteen feet above sea level and nottwenty yards from him. He stood undecided with his legs well apart,peering from side to side in every direction to see where I had gone,very anxious and shifty. I was equally anxious but immovable.Presently he drew nearer to the ladder and, strangely enough, I feltsafer when he came below me, and he passed almost under me, looking inat the doorways of the unfinished building. Then he doubtfully turnedand looked back at a shed behind him, thinking I might have gone inthere, and finally started off, and ran on round the next corner ofthe building. The moment he disappeared I finished the rest of my runup the ladder and safely reached the platform of the scaffolding.The workmen were not yet upon the building, so I had the whole placeto myself. My first act was to look for another ladder as a line ofescape in case of being chased. It is always well to have a back doorto your hiding place; that is one of the essentials in scouting.Presently I found a short ladder leading from my platform to thestage below, but it did not go to the ground. Peering quietly over thescaffolding, I saw my friend the policeman below, still at fault. Iblessed my stars that he was no tracker, and therefore had not seen myfootmarks leading to the foot of the ladder.Then I proceeded to take note of my surroundings and to gatherinformation. Judging from the design of the building, its greatchimneys, etc., I was actually on the new power-house. From my postI had an excellent view over the dockyard, and within 100 feet of mewere the excavation works of the new dock, whose dimensions I couldeasily estimate.I whipped out my prismatic compass and quickly took the bearings oftwo conspicuous points on the neighbouring hills, and so fixed theposition which could be marked on a large scale map for purposes ofshelling the place, if desired.Meantime my pursuer had called the other policeman to him, and theywere in close confabulation immediately below me, where I couldwatch them through a crack between two of the foot-boards. They hadevidently come to the conclusion that I was not in the power-house asthe interior was fully open to view, and they had had a good look intoit. Their next step was to examine the goods shed close by, which wasevidently full of building lumber, etc.One man went into it while the other remained outside on the linethat I should probably take for escaping, that is, between it andthe boundary wall leading to the gateway. By accident rather than bydesign he stood close to the foot of my ladder, and thus cut off myretreat in that direction. While they were thus busy they were leavingthe gate unguarded, and I thought it was too good a chance to bemissed, so, returning along the scaffolding until I reached the smallladder, I climbed down this on to the lower story, and, seeing no oneabout, I quickly swarmed down one of the scaffolding poles and landedsafely on the ground close behind the big chimney of the building.Here I was out of sight, although not far from the policeman guardingthe ladder; and, taking care to keep the corner of the buildingbetween us, I made my way round to the back of the lodge, and thenslipped out of the gate without being seen.SPYING ON MOUNTAIN TROOPS.I was once in a country where the mountain troops on their frontierwere said to be of a wonderfully efficient kind, but nobody knew muchabout their organisation or equipment or their methods of working, soI was sent to see if I could find out anything about them, I got inamongst the mountains at the time when their annual manoeuvres weregoing on, and I found numbers of troops quartered in the valleysand billeted in all the villages. But these all appeared to be theordinary type of troops, infantry, artillery of the line, etc. Theartillery were provided with sledges by which the men could pull theguns up the mountain sides with ropes, and the infantry were suppliedwith alpenstocks to help them in getting over the bad ground. Forsome days I watched the manoeuvres, but saw nothing very striking toreport.Then one evening in passing through a village where they were billetedI saw a new kind of soldier coming along with three pack mules. Heevidently belonged to those mountain forces of which, so far, I hadseen nothing. I got into conversation with him, and found that hehad come down from the higher ranges in order to get supplies for hiscompany which was high up among the snow peaks, and entirely out ofreach of the troops manoeuvring on the lower slopes.He incidentally told me that the force to which he belonged was avery large one, composed of artillery and infantry, and that theywere searching amongst the glaciers and the snows for another forcewhich was coming as an enemy against them, and they hoped to comeinto contact with them probably the very next day. He then roughlyindicated to me the position in which his own force was bivouackingthat night, on the side of a high peak called the "Wolf's Tooth."By condoling with him on the difficult job he would have to getthrough, and suggesting impossible roads by which he could climb, heeventually let out to me exactly the line which the path took, and Irecognised that it would be possible to arrive there during the nightwithout being seen.So after dark, when the innkeeper thought I was safely in bed, Iquietly made my way up the mountain side to where the "Wolf's Tooth"stood up against the starry sky as a splendid landmark to guide me.There was no difficulty in passing through the village with its groupsof soldiers strolling about off duty, but on the roads leading out ofit many sentries were posted, and I feared that they would scarcelylet me pass without inquiring as to who I was and where I was going.So I spent a considerable time in trying to evade these, and was atlast fortunate in discovering a storm drain leading between high wallsup a steep bank into an orchard, through which I was able to slip awayunseen by the sentries guarding the front of the village. I climbed upby such paths and goat tracks as I could find leading in the directiondesired. I failed to strike the mule path indicated by my friendthe driver, but with the peak of the Wolf's Tooth outlined above meagainst the stars, I felt that I could not go far wrong--and so itproved in the event.It was a long and arduous climb, but just as dawn began to light upthe eastern sky I found myself safely on the crest, and the twinklingof the numerous camp fires showed me where the force was bivouackedwhich I had come to see.As the daylight came on the troops began to get on the move, and,after early coffee, were beginning to spread themselves about themountain side, taking up positions ready for attack or defence, soas it grew lighter I hastened to find for myself a comfortable littleknoll, from which I hoped to be able to see all that went on withoutmyself being seen; and for a time all went particularly well.Troops deployed themselves in every direction. Look-out men withtelescopes were posted to spy on the neighbouring hills, and I couldsee where the headquarters staff were gathered together to discussthe situation. Gradually they came nearer to the position I myself wasoccupying, and divided themselves into two parties; the one with thegeneral remained standing where they were, while the other came in thedirection of the mound on which I was lying.Then to my horror some of them began to ascend my stronghold.I at once stood up and made no further efforts at concealment, but gotout my sketch book and started to make a drawing of "Dawn Among theMountains." I was very soon noticed, and one or two officers walkedover to me and entered into conversation, evidently anxious to findout who I was and what was my business there.My motto is that a smile and a stick will carry you through anydifficulty; the stick was obviously not politic on this occasion; Itherefore put on a double extra smile and showed them my sketch book,explaining that the one ambition of my life was to make a drawing ofthe Wolf's Tooth by sunrise.They expressed a respectful interest, and then explained that theirobject in being there was to make an attack from the Wolf's Tooth onthe neighbouring mountain, provided that the enemy were actually inpossession of it. I on my part showed a mild but tactful interest intheir proceedings.The less interest I showed, the more keen they seemed to be to explainmatters to me, until eventually I had the whole of their schemeexposed before me, illustrated by their own sketch maps of thedistrict, which were far more detailed and complete than anything ofthe kind I had seen before.In a short time we were on the best of terms; they had coffee goingwhich they shared with me, while I distributed my cigarettes andchocolates amongst them. They expressed surprise at my having climbedup there at that early hour, but were quite satisfied when I explainedthat I came from Wales, and at once jumped to the conclusion that Iwas a Highlander, and asked whether I wore a kilt when I was at home.In the middle of our exchange of civilities the alarm was given thatthe enemy was in sight, and presently we saw through our glasses longstrings of men coming from all directions towards us over the snows.Between us and the enemy lay a vast and deep ravine with almostperpendicular sides, traversed here and there by zig-zagging goattracks.Officers were called together, the tactics of the fight were describedto them, and in a few minutes the battalion and company commanderswere scattered about studying with their glasses the oppositemountain, each, as they explained to me at the time, picking out forhimself and for his men a line for ascending to the attack.Then the word was given for the advance, and the infantry went off inlong strings of men armed with alpenstocks and ropes. Ropes were usedfor lowering each other down bad places, and for stringing the mentogether when they got on to the snows to save them from fallinginto crevasses, etc. But the exciting point of the day was when theartillery proceeded to move down into the ravine; the guns were allcarried in sections on the backs of mules, as well as their ammunitionand spare parts.In a few minutes tripods were erected, the mules were put into slings,guns and animals were then lowered one by one into the depths belowuntil landed on practicable ground. Here they were loaded up again andgot into their strings for climbing up the opposite mountains, and inan incredibly short space of time both mules and infantry were to beseen, like little lines of ants, climbing by all the available trackswhich could be found leading towards the ice fields above.The actual results of the field day no longer interested me; I hadseen what I had come for--the special troops, their guns, their supplyand hospital arrangements, their methods of moving in this apparentlyimpassable country, and their maps and ways of signalling.All was novel, all was practical. For example, on looking at one ofthe maps shown to me, I remarked that I should have rather expected tofind on it every goat track marked, but the officer replied that therewas no need for that; every one of his men was born in this valley,and knew every goat track over the mountain. Also a goat track did notremain for more than a few weeks, or at most a few months, owing tolandslips and washouts; they are continually being altered, and tomark them on a map would lead to confusion.POSING AS AN ARTIST.My mountain climbing came into use on another occasion of a somewhatsimilar kind. A map had been sent me by my superiors of a mountainousdistrict in which it had been stated that three forts had recentlybeen built. It was only known generally what was the situation ofthese forts, and no details had been secured as to their size orarmament.On arriving at the only town in the neighbourhood, my first fewdays were spent strolling about looking generally at the mountainsamongst which the forts were supposed to be. I had meantime made theacquaintance through my innkeeper of one or two local sportsmen of theplace, and I inquired among them as to the possibilities of partridgeor other shooting among the mountains when the season came on.I told them that I enjoyed camping out for a few days at a time insuch country for sketching and shooting purposes. I asked as to thepossibilities of hiring tents and mules to carry them, and a goodmuleteer was recommended to me, who knew the whole of the countryside,and could tell me all the likely spots that there were for campinggrounds.Eventually I engaged him to take me for a day or two in exploring theneighbourhood, with a view to fixing on camping grounds and seeing theview. We went for a considerable distance along a splendid high roadwhich led up into the mountains. As we got into the high parts hesuggested that we should leave the road and clamber down into theravine, along which we could go for some distance and then reascendand rejoin the road higher up.He then explained that this was a military road, and that it would bedesirable to leave it for a space in order to avoid the guard-houseupon it, where a sentry was posted with orders to allow no one beyondthat point.We successfully evaded the guard-house according to his direction, andeventually found ourselves on the road again, in a position well uptowards the top of the ridge; but on our left as we progressed up theroad was a steep minor ridge which we presently proceeded to ascend.When we were near the top he said to me with a knowing grin:--"Now if you look over there, you will see before you exactly what youwant."And as I looked over I found below me one of the new forts. It wasexactly what I wanted to see spread before my eyes like a map. Isimply had to take a bird's-eye view of it to get its complete plan.Beyond it on another ridge lay another fort, and almost behind me Icould see part of the third, while beyond and above were still moreforts up on the heights. I had got into a regular nest of them.My position on the ridge gave me a splendid view of mountains, andreferring to them I said:--"Yes, indeed, you have brought me to exactly the right spot."But he grinned again maliciously, pointing down to the fort, andsaid:--"Yes, but that is the best view of all, I think."He seemed to grasp my intentions most fully. Far below the fortslay the straits which they were designed to protect for the vesselssteaming through them. I started at once to make a sketch of thepanorama, carefully omitting that ground where the forts lay, partlyin order to disarm my friend's suspicions, and partly to protect me inthe event of my arrest.Presently my companion volunteered to go down to the fort and bringup his brother, who, he said, was a gunner stationed there, and couldgive me every detail that I could wish about their guns, etc.This sounded almost too good to be true, but with the greatestindifference I said I should be glad to see him, and off went myfriend. The moment that he was out of sight I took care to move offinto a neighbouring kopje where I could hide myself in case of hisbringing up a force of men to capture me.From here I was able to make a pretty accurate sketch of the fort andits gun emplacements on the inside of the lining of my hat, and when Ihad replaced this I went on as hurriedly as possible with my sketch toshow that I had been fully occupied during the guide's absence.Presently I saw him returning, but as he was only accompanied by oneother man, I crept down again to my original position and receivedthem smiling.The gunner was most communicative, and told me all about his guns andtheir sizes and what were their powers as regards range and accuracy.He told me that once a year an old vessel that was about to be brokenup was towed along behind a steamer down the straits to afford atarget to the defence forts as she passed on. He said regretfully:--"We are number three fort, and so far, no vessel has ever successfullypassed one and two--they always get sunk before they reach us"--and hegave me the exact range and the number of rounds fired, which showedthat their shooting was pretty good.Many other details I found out as to the number of the men, theirfeeding and hospital arrangements; and a few days later I was ableto take myself home with a good stock of valuable information andthe good wishes and hopes of my various friends that I some day wouldreturn to shoot the partridges. But I am certain that one man was nottaken in by my professions, either as an artist or as a sportsman, andthat was the muleteer.FOOLING A GERMAN SENTRY.On another occasion I wanted to ascertain what value there was in themusketry training of a foreign infantry. Also it had been reportedthat they had recently acquired a new form of machine gun which was aparticularly rapid firer and very accurate in its effects. Its calibrewas known, and its general pattern (from photographs), but its actualcapabilities were still a matter of conjecture.On this occasion I thought the simplest way would be to goundisguised. Without any concealment I went to stay in garrison townswhere I happened to know one or two officers. I obtained introductionsto other officers, and gradually became their companion at meals andat their evening entertainments. They mounted me on their horses, Irode with them on their rounds of duty, and I came to be an attendantat their field days and manoeuvres; but whenever we approached therifle ranges I was always politely but firmly requested to go nofurther, but to await their return, since the practice was absolutelyconfidential. I could gain no information from them as to what went onwithin the enclosure where the rifle range was hidden.Two of my English friends one day incautiously stopped at the entrancegate to one of the ranges, and were promptly arrested and kept in theguard-room for some hours, and finally requested to leave the place,without getting much satisfaction out of it. So I saw that cautionwas necessary. Little by little, especially after some very cheerfulevenings, I elicited a certain amount of information from my friendsas to what the new machine gun did and was likely to do, and how theirsoldiers could of course never hit a running target, since it was withthe greatest difficulty they hit the standing one at all. But morethan this it was impossible to get.However, I moved on to another military station, where as a strangerI tried another tack. The rifle ranges were surrounded by a beltof trees, outside of which was an unclimbable fence guarded by twosentries, one on either side. It seemed impossible to get into or evennear the range without considerable difficulty.One day I sauntered carelessly down in the direction of the range ata point far away from the entrance gate, and here I lay down on thegrass as if to sleep, but in reality to listen and take the rate ofthe shooting from the sound and also the amount of success by thesound of the hits on the iron target. Having gained a certain amountof data in this way, I approached more nearly in the hope of getting asight of what was going on.While the sentry's back was turned I made a rush for the fence, andthough I could not get over, I found a loose plank through which I wasable to get a good view of what was happening.While engaged at this, to my horror the sentry suddenly turned on histracks and came back towards me. But I had been prepared against sucheventualities, and jamming back the plank into its place, I producedfrom my pocket a bottle of brandy which I had brought for the purpose.Half of it had been already sprinkled over my clothes, so that whenthe man approached he found me in a state of drunkenness, smellingvilely of spirits, and profuse in my offers to him to share thebottle.[Illustration: _The above sketch shows the writer in a tight place.He was discovered in close proximity to a rifle range by a Germansentry. He pretended to be intoxicated, and so escaped. But it was aclose shave._]He could make nothing of me, and therefore gently but firmly conductedme to the end of his beat and thrust me forth and advised me to gohome, which I did in great content....A SPY IS SUSPICIOUS.The practice of spying has one unfortunate tendency: it teaches oneto trust no one, not even a would-be benefactor. A foreign countryhad recently manufactured a new form of field gun which was undergoingextensive secret trials, which were being conducted in one of hercolonies in order to avoid being watched. I was sent to find outparticulars of this gun. On arrival in the colony I found that abattery of new guns was carrying out experiments at a distant pointalong the railway.The place was by all description merely a roadside station, with noteven a village near it, so it would be difficult to go and stay therewithout being noticed at once. The timetable, however, showed thatthe ordinary day train stopped there for half an hour for change ofengines, so I resolved to see what I could do in the space of timeallowed.We jogged along in the local train happily enough and stopped at everylittle station as we went. At one of these a Colonial farmer enteredmy carriage, and though apparently ill and doleful, we got intoconversation on the subject of the country and the crops.At length we drew up at the station where the guns were said to be.Eagerly looking from the window, my delight may be imagined when Isaw immediately outside the station yard the whole battery of gunsstanding parked.Everybody left the train to stretch their legs, and I did not losea moment in hurrying through the station and walking out to have acloser look at what I had come to see.The sentry on the guns was on the further side from me, and thereforeI was able to have a pretty close look at the breech action andvarious other items before he could come round to my side. But he veryquickly noticed my presence, and not only came himself, but shouted toanother man whom I had not so far seen behind a corner of the stationwall.This was the corporal of the guard, who rushed at me and began abusingme with every name he could lay his tongue to for being here withoutpermit. I tried to explain that I was merely a harmless passenger bythe train coming out to stretch my legs, and had never noticed hisrotten old guns? But he quickly shoo'd me back into the station.I betook myself once more to the carriage, got out my field glasses,and continued my investigations from the inside of the carriage, whereI had quite a good view of the guns outside the station, and was ableto note a good deal of information painted on them as to their weight,calibre, etc. Suddenly in the midst of my observations I found theview was obscured, and looking up, I found the face of the corporalpeering in at me; he had caught me in the act. But nothing more cameof it at the moment.My farmer friend presently returned to his place, the whistle sounded,and the train lumbered on.When I resumed conversation with the Colonist I remarked on hisinvalid appearance and enquired about his health. The poor man, withtears running down his cheeks, then confessed to me it was not illnessof body, but worry of the mind that was preying upon him.He had utterly failed in his attempt at making a successful farm, andhad entered the train with the idea of cutting his throat, and wouldhave done so had I not been there to prevent him. Life was over forhim, and he did not know what to do. I got him to talk about hislosses, and offered suggestions to him based on the experiences of afriend of mine who was also a farmer in that country, and who for tenyears had failed until the right method came to him in the eleventhyear, and he was now making his business a huge success.This put hope at once into my volatile companion. He bucked up andbecame cheerful and confidential. Finally he said:"You have done me a good turn. I will do something for you. I knowthat you are a German spy, and I know that you are going to bearrested at the station where this train stops for the night. You werespotted by a non-commissioned officer at the last station, and whileI was in the telegraph office he came in and sent a telegram to theCommandant of the terminal station, reporting that a German spy hadbeen examining the guns and was travelling by this train in thiscarriage."I at once laughed genially at the mistake made, and explained to himthat I was not a German at all. He replied that that would not availme--I should be arrested all the same if I went on to the end of thejourney."But," he suggested, "I shall be getting out myself at the very nextstation to go back to my farm, and my advice to you is to get outthere also. You will find a good inn where you can put up for thenight, and to-morrow morning the early train will take you on cleanthrough that very station where the military commandant will be on thelook-out for you to-night."I replied that, as an Englishman, I had nothing to fear, and I shouldgo on.At the next station accordingly he got out, and after an affectionatefarewell, I went on. But there was yet another station between thisand the night stop, and on arrival there I took the hint of my friendand got out and spent the night at the little inn of the place.Following his advice still further, I took the early train nextmorning and ran through the place where they had been looking outfor me. I had not got out when he invited me to at his station lesthis invitation might merely have been a trap to test whether I was aspy; had I accepted it, no doubt he might have had friends at handto arrange my arrest. As it was, I came away scot free with all theinformation I wanted about the new gun.HOODWINKING A TURKISH SENTRY.A big new Turkish fort had been recently built, and my business was toget some idea of its plan and construction. From my inn in the townI sauntered out early one morning before sunrise, hoping to find nosentries awake, so that I could take the necessary angles and pace thedesired bases in order to plot in a fairly accurate plan of it.To some extent I had succeeded when I noticed among the sandhillsanother fellow looking about, and, it seemed to me, trying to dodgeme. This was rather ominous, and I spent some of my time trying toevade this "dodger," imagining that he was necessarily one of theguard attempting my capture.In evading him, unfortunately, I exposed myself rather more than usualto view from the fort, and presently was challenged by one of thesentries. I did not understand his language, but I could understandhis gesture well enough when he presented his rifle and tookdeliberate aim at me. This induced me to take cover as quicklyas might be behind a sandhill, where I sat down and waited for aconsiderable time to allow the excitement to cool down.Presently, who should I see creeping round the corner of aneighbouring sandhill but my friend the "dodger"! It was too late toavoid him, and the moment he saw me he appeared to wish to go awayrather than to arrest me. We then recognised that we were mutuallyafraid of each other, and therefore came together with a certainamount of diffidence on both sides.However, we got into conversation, in French, and I very soon foundthat, although representatives of different nationalities, we wereboth at the same game of making a plan of the fort. We thereforejoined forces, and behind a sandhill we compared notes as to whatinformation we had already gained, and then devised a little plan bywhich to complete the whole scheme.My friend took his place in a prominent position with his back to thefort and commenced to smoke, with every appearance of indifference tothe defence work behind him. This was meant to catch the sentry's eyeand attract his attention while I did some creeping and crawling andgot round the other side of the work, where I was able to complete oursurvey in all its details.[Illustration: _A sketch showing how I and another spy managed toobtain drawings of a fort absolutely under the eyes of a sentry. Thespy on the right of the picture is doing nothing more than attractingthe attention of the sentry while on the left of the picture I ammaking the necessary drawings._]It was late that night when we met in the "dodger's" bedroom, and wemade complete tracings and finished drawings, each of us taking hisown copy for his own headquarters. A day or two later we took steamertogether for Malta, where we were to part on our respective homewardjourneys--he on his way back to Italy.As we both had a day or two to wait at Malta, I acted as host to himduring his stay. As we entered the harbour I pointed out to him thebig 110-ton guns which at that time protected the entrance, and werevisible to anybody with two eyes in his head. I pointed out variousother interesting batteries to him which were equally obvious, butI omitted to mention other parts which would have been of greaterinterest to him.He came away from Malta, however, with the idea that, on the whole, hehad done a good stroke of business for his Government by going there,and convinced of his luck in getting hold of a fairly simple thing inthe shape of myself to show him around.It was my good fortune to meet him a few years later, when perhapsunwittingly he returned the compliment which I had done him in Malta.He was then in charge of a large arsenal in one of the colonies of hiscountry. This was situated in a citadel perched on a high ridge with arapid river flowing around the base.My orders at that time were to try and ascertain whether anyorganisation existed in this colony for mobilising the natives asa reserve, should the regular troops be called away for actionelsewhere. Also whether there was any means arranged for arming thesenatives; if so, in what way and in what numbers.Knowing that my friend was quartered in the place, I called upon himas the first step, without any definite plan in my mind as to how Iwas to set about getting the information. He was kind enough to takeme for a tour of inspection round the town, down to the river, and upin the citadel.By a lucky chance I got on to the idea that the citadel ought to belit with electric light since the water power produced by the torrentbelow could work a dynamo at very low cost if properly engineered.This was so much in my thoughts that as we went through the barracksand buildings in the fort, I kept pointing out how easily andinexpensively places might be wired and lit. And I gradually persuadedhim that it was a matter that he should take up and suggest to hissuperior.Finally, when he had seen almost everything, my friend remarked: "Idon't suppose you would care to see inside the arsenal, it is so muchlike many others you must have seen before." But I assured him thatit would interest me very much; in fact, it was rather essential toforming any approximate estimate for the lighting; and so he took mein.There was gallery after gallery filled with racks of arms, allbeautifully kept, and over the door of each room was the name ofthe tribe and the number of men who could be mobilised in the eventof their being required, and the number of arms and the amount ofammunition that was available for each.After taking me through two or three rooms, he said: "There are manymore like this, but you have probably seen enough." But I eagerlyexclaimed that I must see the others in order to judge of thiselectric lighting scheme. If there were many more rooms it mightnecessitate an extra sized dynamo, therefore a greater expense, butI hoped that by due economy in the number of lamps to be able to keepdown to the original estimate which I had thought of.So we went steadily through all the rooms, looking at the places wherelamps might be most economically established, and I made calculationswith pencil and paper, which I showed him, while I jotted on my shirtcuff the names of the tribes and the other information required by mysuperiors at home--which I did not show him.The armament of native auxiliaries and their organisation and numberswere thus comparatively easily found out--thanks to that little strokeof luck which I repeat so often comes in to give success whether inscouting or spying.But a more difficult job was to ascertain the practical fighting valueof such people.TEA AND A TURK.Reports had got about that some wonderful new guns had been installedin one of the forts on the Bosphorus and that a great deal of secrecywas observed in their being put up. It became my duty to go and findout any particulars about them.My first day in Constantinople was spent under the guidance of anAmerican lady in seeing the sights of the city, and when we hadvisited almost all the usual resorts for tourists she asked whetherthere was anything else that I wanted to see, and to a certainextent I let her into my confidence when I told her that I would giveanything to see the inside of one of these forts, if it were possible.She at once said she would be delighted to take me to see her oldfriend Hamid Pasha, who was quartered in one of them and was alwayswilling to give her and her friends a cup of tea.When we arrived at the gate of the fort the sentry and the officer incharge would on no account allow us to pass until the lady said thatshe was a friend of the Pasha, when we were at once admitted andpassed to his quarters.He was a charming host, and received us with the greatest kindness,and after showing us his own quarters and the many curiosities he hadcollected he took us all round the fort and pointed out its ancientand modern devices for defence, and finally showed us its guns. Twoof these, in a somewhat prominent position where they could easily beseen from outside, were covered with canvas covers.My excitement naturally grew intense when I saw these, and I secretlybegged the lady to persuade him to allow us to look at them, and heat once acquiesced, thinking I was an American, and, grinning all overhis face, said, "These are our very latest development."I almost trembled as the covers were drawn off, and then I recognisedguns, truly of a modern make but not very new nor powerful, and thenhe gave away the whole secret by saying: "Of course, we are trying toimpress a certain power with the idea that we are re-arming our forts,and therefore we are letting it be known that we are keeping theseguns a dead secret and covered from view of any spies."On another occasion it fell to my lot to inspect some of the defencesof the Dardanelles, and I found it could best be done from theseaward. This involved my taking passage in an old grain steamerrunning between Odessa and Liverpool, and my voyage in her was one ofthe most charming and original that it has been my lot to take.A tramp steamer loaded down with grain until its cargo is almostrunning out of the ventilators is--contrary to all expectations--quitea comfortable boat for cruising in. The captain and his wife livedin comfortable cabins amidships under the bridge; the after deck wasstocked with pigs and chickens, which fed liberally on the cargo. Thecaptain's good lady was a Scotch woman, and therefore an excellentcook.Everything was most clean and comfortable, and the captain mostthoroughly entered into my various schemes for observing and examiningthe defences of the coast as we went along.He allowed me practically to take command of the ship as regardsher course and anchoring. From side to side of the Dardanelles wewandered, and when we came abreast of one of the forts that neededstudy we anchored ship.Our erratic procedure naturally invited investigation, and when aGovernment pilot boat put off to enquire our reason for anchoring ina certain bay he came to the conclusion that our steering gear was notin very good order and that we had stopped to repair it.While the ship was at anchor a boat was lowered and I whiled away thetime, nominally in fishing, but really in cruising about close to theforts and fishing for information rather than for fish by observingthe different types of the guns employed and sketching their positionand the radius of fire allowed to take them by the splay of theirembrasures; also we took soundings where necessary and made sketchmaps of possible landing places for attacking or other purposes.SORE FEET.Bosnia and Herzegovina were under Austrian protection and weresupplying a new contingent of infantry to the Austrian army. Thisforce was said to have most marvellous powers of marching andendurance, something hitherto unheard of among European nations. I wastold off to ascertain how great these powers might be and what was thesecret of their success.I visited them in their own country. But before I arrived there Ihad passed through Montenegro, and I had there received reports fromMontenegrins, which to some extent discounted the high praise given tothem. When I asked a Montenegrin his opinion of his neighbours in thematter of marching and hill climbing, he could only contemptuouslyspit. And then he explained to me that any fool can go uphill, but aMontenegrin is the only man who can go downhill.He pointed to the round tower in Cettinje, and told me within it layseveral piles of Turks' head, for the reason that every Montenegrinwho could show a heap of nine Turks' heads gathered by himself wasentitled to a gold medal from the Prince.Their method of gaining Turks' heads was this:A party of them would make a raid into Turkish territory and get afew cattle or women. They would then be pursued by the Turks into themountains, and they would make their way hurriedly up the mountainside just sufficiently far ahead to lead the Turks on to pursue themeagerly. When the Turks had become well strung out in the pursuit, theMontenegrins would suddenly turn on them and charge down the mountainside.There was no escape for the Turks. They were only ordinary mortals,and could not run downhill. And he showed me his great bare knee, andslapping it with pride, he said: "That is what takes you downhill,and no other nation has a knee like the Montenegrins. And as for theBosnians--" then he spat!However, as the Bosnians were reported to be doing such great thingsin the marching line for the Austrian army, my next step was to visitthe Austrian manoeuvres and watch them.It is usual for a military attaché to be sent officially to watch suchmanoeuvres, and he is the guest of the Government concerned. But inthat position, it is very difficult for him to see behind the scenes.He is only shown what they want him to see. My duty was to go behindthe scenes as much as possible and get other points of view.I accordingly attached myself to a squad of infantry, with whom Ispent a couple of days and nights. I had come to a certain town, andcould find no room in the place where I could sleep. The hotels werecrammed, and even in the shops men were billeted to sleep on and underthe counters, as also in every garret and archway in the place.Finally, I went to the station and asked the stationmaster if I couldsleep in a railway carriage. He informed me that all these were filledwith troops; but one of the railway men who came from the signal-boxa short way down the line took pity on me, and told me if I likedthere was his cabin, which I could share with his brother, who was acorporal, and his squad of men, and that I might find room to lie downthere.I gladly climbed the steps into the signal-box, and was made welcomeby the corporal and his men in sharing their supplies, and aftersupper and a chat I bedded down amongst them.It was interesting to see how conscientiously this little party didits work. At every hour during the night the corporal went out andinspected his sentry, just as if on active service, and patrols werefrequent and reports handed in, although no officer ever came near theplace.During the next two days we had plenty of experience of marching andcounter-marching, firing and charging; but going along in the rearof the immense mass of troops one soon realised what enormous wastagethere is in stragglers, and especially those with sore feet. So muchso was this the case that wagons came along, picked up the sore-footedmen, and carried them back to the railway, where every evening aspecial train was in attendance to convey them back to their garrison.A few that were missed out by this operation on the field werecollected into their field hospitals, and thus the numbers shown everyday to the general staff of men admitted to hospital for sore feet wasvery small indeed compared with the number that were actually put outof action from that cause.It was soon quite evident that my friend the Montenegrin had not spatwithout reason, and that the Bosnians were no harder in their feetthan the other nationalities in that variegated army.AUSTRIAN OFFICERS.I had a very strong fellow feeling for the Austrian army and itsofficers. They were so very much like our own, but far more amateurishin their knowledge and methods of leading; as old-fashioned as thehills, and liable to make mistakes at every turn.The only one who seemed to realise this was the aged Emperor himself,and when he came flying along it was very like the Duke of Cambridgeat his best with a thunderstorm raging.The army was then commanded by Arch-Dukes, aged men as a rule, and allintensely nervous as to what the Emperor would think of them when hecame along. One could tell when he was coming by watching the feathersin their helmets. An Arch-Duke would look very brave in all his warpaint, but if you watched the green feather above him closely youmight notice it trembling with a distinct shiver when the Emperor wasanywhere in the neighbourhood.Their old-fashioned methods and amateurish leading seem to be paying aheavy price in the present campaign.AN INTERESTING TASK.A new method of illuminating the battlefield at night had beeninvented on the Continent.A chemical substance had been manufactured which enabled the user toturn on a strong light over a wide space at any moment.Rumour said that it was as powerful as a searchlight, and yet could becarried in your pocket. But great secrecy was observed both regardingits composition and its experimental trials.In the same army a new kind of observation balloon was said to be ontrial equipped with some very up-to-date apparatus.Also it was reported that, in addition to these aids to effectivereconnaissance, a new method of swimming rivers by cavalry had beeninvented by which every man and horse in a cavalry division couldcross wide rivers without difficulty or delay.Owing to political strain going on in Europe at the time there was thepossibility that these rumours might have been purposely set on foot,like many others, with a view to giving some moral prestige to thearmy concerned.It became my duty to investigate as far as possible what amount oftruth lay in them.ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICE.It was a difficult country to work in owing to the very stringentpolice arrangements against spies of every kind, and it looked to be amost unpromising task to elicit what I wanted to know, because one wassure of being watched at every turn. As I afterwards discovered, itwas through this multiplicity of police arrangements that one was ableto get about with comparative ease, because if one went boldly enoughit immediately argued to the watchful policeman that someone else wassure to be observing you.Moreover, spies generally do their work single-handed, and on thisoccasion I was accompanied by my brother, and this made it easierfor us to go about as a pair of tourists interested in the countrygenerally. A man travelling alone is much more liable to drawattention upon himself, and therefore to go about under suspicion.Our entry into the country was not altogether fortunate, because whileyet in the train we managed to get into trouble with the guard overa window which he insisted on shutting when we wanted it open. In thesame carriage with us was a gentleman of some standing in the country,and in a fit of absent-mindedness I made a little sketch of him. Ihad just completed it when an arm reached down over my shoulder frombehind and the picture was snatched away by the observant guard of thetrain and taken off to be used as evidence against me.The guard of a train in this country, I may say, ranks apparently muchthe same as a colonel in the army, and therefore is not a man to betrifled with. On our arrival at the terminus we found a sort of guardof honour of gendarmes waiting for us on the platform, and we werepromptly marched off to the police office to account for our procedurein the train by daring to open the window when the guard wished itclosed, and for drawing caricatures of a "high-born" man in the train.We made no secret as to our identity and handed our cards to thecommissary of police when we were brought up before him. He was--tillthat moment--glaring at us fiercely, evidently deciding whatpunishment to give us before he had heard our case at all. But whenhe saw my brother's name as an officer in the Guards, he asked: "Doesthis mean in the Guards of her Majesty Queen Victoria?" When he heardit was so his whole demeanour changed. He sprang from his seat, beggedus to be seated, and explained it was all a mistake. Evidently Guardsin his country were in very high repute. He explained to us therewere certain little irritating rules on the railway which had to beenforced, but, of course, in our case we were not to be bound by suchsmall bye-laws, and with profuse apologies he bowed us out of theoffice, without a stain upon our characters.SUCCESS WITH THE BALLOON.We did not live long without the stain. Our first anxiety was to findwhere and how it would be possible to see some of this equipmentfor which we had come to the country. Manoeuvres were going on at aplace some fifty miles distant, and there, as tourists, we betookourselves without delay. We put up at a small inn not far from therailway-station, and for the next few days we did immense walkingtours, following up the troops and watching them at their work over avery extended area of country.At last one day we sighted a balloon hanging in the sky, and we madea bee line for it until we arrived at its station. When it was hauleddown and anchored to the ground the men went off to the camp to gettheir dinners, and the balloon was left without a soul to guard it.It was not long before we were both inside the car, taking note ofeverything in the shape of the instruments and their makers' names,and so had all the information it was possible to get before the mencame back.HOW TO ENTER A FORT.Our next step was to see this wonderful illuminant for night work,and in the course of our wandering's we came across a large fort fromwhich searchlights had been showing the previous night. There werenotice boards round this fort at a distance of about twenty yardsapart stating that nobody was allowed within this circle of notices,and we argued that if once we were inside any sentry or detectivewould naturally suppose we had leave to be there.We tried the idea, and it worked splendidly. We walked calmly throughcamps and past sentries without a tremor and not a question was askedus. Once within this line we were able to get directly into the fort,and there we strolled along as if the place belonged to us.There is a certain amount of art required in making yourself notappear to be a stranger in a new place.In the minor matter of hat, boots, and necktie it is well towear those bought in the country you are visiting, otherwise yourBritish-made articles are sure to attract the attention of a watchfulpoliceman.In the matter of demeanour you behave as a native would do who wasaccustomed to being there.Walking into a strange fort must be carried out much on the same linesas you would adopt in entering a strange town, only more so. You walkas if with a set purpose to get to a certain part of it, as thoughyou knew the way perfectly, and without showing any kind of interestin what is around you. If you pass an officer or dignitary whom yousee everybody saluting, salute him too, so that you do not appearsingular. When you want to observe any special feature you loaf aboutreading a newspaper or, if in a town, by looking at all you want tosee as reflected in a shop window.The penalty for spying in this country was five years without theoption of a fine, or even of a trial.Having walked in like this, and having successfully walked outagain--which is quite another matter--we felt elated with our successand hung about till nightfall and tried it again after dark. This wasno easy job, as the place was surrounded by outposts very much on the_qui vive_ for an enemy that was to make a manoeuvre attack during thenight. By keeping to leeward of the general position one was able toquietly creep along, sniffing the breeze, until one could judge wherethere was an outpost and where there was open ground, and in thismanner, smelling our way as we went, we were able to creep throughbetween the outposts and so gained the fort.HOW WE GOT THE SECRET LIGHT.This time it meant slipping through unperceived as far as possible,and in this we succeeded equally well. By good fortune we arrivedjust before experiments commenced with the illuminating rockets.Everybody's attention was centred on these and no one had time tonotice or observe what we were doing. We watched the preparations andalso the results, and having studied the routine and the geography ofthe practice we were in the end able to help ourselves to some of therockets and the lighting composition, and with these we eventuallymade off. Without delay we placed our treasures in the hands of atrusty agent who transferred them at once to England.HOW THE BIG RIVER WAS SWUM.Our next step was to see how crossing the river was carried out by thecavalry. From information received we presented ourselves at a certainspot on the river at a little before ten one morning. The officialattachés had received notice that a brigade of cavalry would swim theriver at this point at ten o'clock, and at ten o'clock their specialtrain was due to arrive there.We were there, fortunately, half an hour beforehand, and we saw thewhole brigade come down to the river and file across a fairly deepford, where the horses got wet to some extent, but they did not swim.On the far bank a few men were left behind. These, as it turned out,were all the men and horses who could actually swim well, and as thetrain arrived and the attachés disembarked on to the bank they foundthe major part of the brigade already arrived, dripping wet, and theremainder just swimming over at that moment.Of course in their reports they stated that they had seen the wholebrigade swimming over. But this is how reports very often get aboutwhich are not strictly true.CAUGHT AT LAST.Emboldened by our success in getting into the fort by day and night,we then continued the experiment for several nights in succession,watching the further practice with searchlights, star shells, andlight rockets. We had, however, collected all the information that wasnecessary, and there was no need for us to go there again. But newsreached us that there was to be a final show for the Emperor himself,and I could not resist the temptation of going once more to the fort,as I expected there would be a grand pyrotechnic display for thisoccasion.I got there in good time before the Emperor's arrival, and made myway into the place as usual, my brother remaining outside to seethe effect of the lights from the attacker's point of view. Inside,however, all was not quite the same as it had been on previousoccasions. There were a very large number of officers collectedthere, and a too larger number of police, officers for my liking. I,therefore, repented of my intention and took myself out again.Then as I walked back along the road in the dark I noticed the lightsof the Emperor's _cortege_ coming along towards me. As the firstcarriage passed me I did the worst thing in the world I could havedone at such a moment--I turned my head away to avoid being recognisedin the lamplight. My action made the occupants of the first carriagesuspicious. They were some of the staff officers of the Emperor.In a moment they stopped the carriage, rushed at me, and with scarcelya word, seized and hustled me into the carriage with them, and droveback to the fort again. They asked me a few questions as to who I wasand why I was there, and on arrival at the fort I was handed over tosome other officers and again asked my business.I could only say that I was an Englishman who had been looking on atthe manoeuvres as a spectator and was anxious to find my way to thestation (which was some ten miles away). This was all fairly true, butnot quite good enough for them, and they presently packed me into acarriage and sent me back--in charge of an officer--to the station,with a view to my being handed over to the police and removed to thecapital.It was in the days of my apprenticeship, and I had been exceedinglyfoolish in taking a few notes, which, although undecipherable, perhapswould none the less be used as evidence against me.Therefore, so soon as we were under way I made it my business toquietly tear these notes up into small pieces, and to drop them outof the carriage window whenever my guardian was looking the other way.When we arrived at the station there was some little time to wait, andI asked if I might go to the inn and collect my belongings. Permissionwas granted to me, and I was taken there under the charge of a policeofficer.Hastily I packed my bag, and the good officer endeavoured to help me,packing up anything he could see in the room and thrusting it in withmy things. Unfortunately he kept packing my brother's things in aswell, and so when his back was turned I thrust them back into mybrother's bed, for I did not want it known he was about there too.Having finally filled my portmanteau, my next care was to leave awarning lest he too should be entrapped. So while ostensibly payingthe bill to the landlord of the house, who had been called up by thepolice, I wrote a warning note on a scrap of paper, which I jammed onthe candle, where my brother could not fail to find it when he camehome later on, and then I went off to the station, and was taken backto the capital by a Hussar officer of congenial temperament.With all good feeling and the true hospitality of his kind,he insisted on buying half a dozen bottles of beer for myconsumption--since I was an Englishman--and he helped me with theordeal during the small hours of the morning.On reaching the capital I was put into a hotel, my passport taken fromme, and I was told that I should be expected to remain there untilcalled for. In the meantime I might go about the city, but was notto take myself away without permission. I very soon found that I wasbeing watched by a detective told off for the purpose, and then it wasthat I made the acquaintance of a foreign spy who was acting as waiterin the hotel. He was so well informed on higher politics, as wellas on military matters, that I guessed he must be an officer of theintelligence staff, and he was most helpful and kind to me in mypredicament.He pointed out to me who were the detectives in the hotel staff, andinformed me that their duty was merely to watch me, to ascertain whatmy moves were day by day, and to report them by telephone to the headpolice office. He advised me before going out each day to inform thehall porter, thereby letting the detectives overhear what were myplans; they would then telephone to the police, who would have theirown detectives watching me while I was out.THE ESCAPE.Within a short time my brother rejoined me from the manoeuvre area,but by doing so he at once came under observation and under suspicion,and we were practically a pair of prisoners. So much was this the casethat a few days later we received a visit at daybreak one morning,from a friend in power, who was also in touch with the police, andhe advised us that the best course we could take was to escape fromthe country while it was possible, he undertaking quietly to makearrangements for us. The idea was that we should slip away to aseaport, where we could get on to a British steamer as two of the crewand so pass out of the country.That was the scheme. But the difficulty was how to play it off. A shipwas found whose captain was willing to receive us provided that wecould get to him without being observed. With the aid of our friendlywaiter, we let the detective at the hotel understand that we weretired of being under suspicion, and that we were boldly going to takethe train and leave the country.At ten o'clock a cab was to come round to take us and our luggage tothe station, and if anybody interfered with us--why, we were freebornBritish, and subject to no man's rule, and the Ambassador and all therest of the Powers should hear about it! This was for the informationof the detective, and he merely telephoned it to the police office atthe railway station, where we should be arrested at the point of ourdeparture.We got into our cab and drove off down the street towards the stationuntil we were out of sight of the hotel. Then we called to our driverand said we should like to go to a different station. This courseinvolved our going to the river-side and taking the ferry.It was an anxious time. Had we been spotted? Should we be missed? Werewe being followed?These questions would answer themselves as we progressed with ourplot. The answer, when it came, would mean a tremendous lot tous--triumph or five years' imprisonment; so we had every right to befairly anxious. And yet, somehow, I don't think we were worrying muchabout the consequences, but rather were busy with the present--as tohow to evade pursuit and recapture.Arrived at the ferry we paid off our cabman and made our way to thequay-side. Here we found a boat which had already been arranged for;and we made our way safely off to the ship, which was waiting understeam in midstream to start the moment we were on board.At this supreme moment my brother had the temerity to argue with theboatman over the fare. Being now in the last stage of tender-hooks, Iadjured him to give the man double what he asked, if only to be free.But the brother was calm, and for once--he was right! His display ofwant of all anxiety quite diverted any kind of suspicion that mighthave attached to us, and in the end we got safely on board and away.CONCLUSION.Such are some of the minor experiences which, though not verysensational in themselves, are yet part of the every-day work ofan "intelligence agent" (_alias_ a spy), and while they tend torelieve such work of any suspicion of monotony, they add, as a rule,that touch of romance and excitement to it which makes spying thefascinating sport that it is.When one recognises also that it may have invaluable results for one'scountry in time of war, one feels that even though it is a time spentlargely in enjoyment, it is not by any means time thrown idly away;and though the "agent," if caught, may "go under," unhonoured andunsung, he knows in his heart of hearts that he has done as bravelyfor his country as his comrade who falls in battle.       *       *       *       *       *Books for War Time.       *       *       *       *       *FIRST FROM THE FRONT.
